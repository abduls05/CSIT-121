        <h2>Engine Basics</h2>
        <p>
            An engine is a machine that turns different types of energy into mechanical power. In most car engines, this happens by burning a mix of fuel and air. 
            When the fuel burns, it creates high-pressure gases that push pistons up and down inside cylinders. These pistons are connected to a crankshaft, 
            which changes their up-and-down motion into circular motion. That circular motion is what makes the wheels turn and moves the car forward. 
            Engines need the right mix of fuel, air, and spark to work well. They have different parts like intake valves, compression chambers, and exhaust systems 
            to make sure everything runs smoothly and cleanly. Understanding how engines work is important for knowing how cars and machines operate.</p>

        <h2>Engine Components</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cylinder: The chamber where fuel and air are mixed, compressed, and burned to produce power.</li>
            <li>Piston: Moves up and down inside the cylinder due to combustion, transferring energy to the crankshaft.</li>
            <li>Crankshaft: Converts the linear motion of the piston into rotational motion, which is used to turn the wheels.</li>
            <li>Camshaft: Controls the opening and closing of intake and exhaust valves to let air in and exhaust gases out of the cylinder.</li>
            <li>Valves (Intake and Exhaust): Regulate the flow of air and fuel into the cylinder and allow exhaust gases to exit after combustion.</li>
            <li>Spark Plug: Provides the spark that ignites the air-fuel mixture in gasoline engines.</li>
            <li>Fuel Injector/Carburetor: Delivers the right amount of fuel into the air intake for combustion.</li>
            <li>Cylinder Head: Covers the top of the cylinder and houses the valves, spark plugs, and sometimes the fuel injectors.</li>
            <li>Engine Block: Houses the cylinders, pistons, and crankshaft, forming the main structure of the engine.</li>
            <li>Oil Pan: Contains the engine oil that lubricates moving parts like the crankshaft and pistons.</li>

        <h2>Engine Operation</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>A 4-cylinder engine has four cylinders arranged in a line or in a compact formation. Each cylinder houses a piston that moves up and down inside it. 
            When fuel and air mix together and ignite, it creates a small explosion that pushes the piston down. This motion turns the crankshaft, which then transfers power to the wheels through the 
            transmission. 4-cylinder engines are often used in smaller cars and compact vehicles because they are fuel-efficient and take up less space under the hood.</li>

        <li> A 6-cylinder engine, on the other hand, has six cylinders that are usually arranged in a straight line (inline-6) or in a V-shape (V6). With more cylinders, 
            a 6-cylinder engine can produce more power and torque compared to a 4-cylinder engine. This makes them suitable for mid-sized to larger vehicles, including sedans, SUVs, and trucks. 
            The additional cylinders allow for smoother operation and more balanced power delivery.</li>
            
        <li> An 8-cylinder engine, also known as a V8 engine, consists of eight cylinders arranged in a V-shape configuration. V8 engines are known for their high-performance capabilities, 
            producing substantial horsepower and torque. They are commonly found in sports cars, muscle cars, and large trucks where strong acceleration and towing capacity are desired. 
            However, V8 engines are less fuel-efficient compared to 4-cylinder and 6-cylinder engines due to their larger size and higher power output.</li>
        </ul>
