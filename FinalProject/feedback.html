            <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
            <p>CSIT 121 has been one of the most challenging but informative and fun class i've taken in a while
                I truly enjoyed the class, topics, and learning experience. 

                <br>I've learned so much more about HTML.
                Before this class, i only knew how to type paragraphs, change text and change the web page color all using internal css. 

                <br>I've now learnt how to properly structure my website and use external css, which is ten times better than internal css because it keeps html code clutter free.
                Using lists, headers, footers, etc has become very easy to me.

                <br>One of the things that really stood out to me in this class is the use of div. The options are limitless when using div.

                <br> I would like to continue learning about HTML, i feel this class only scratched the surface and there is so much more to be uncovered.
